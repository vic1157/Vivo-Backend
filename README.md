# Vivo-Backend
Objective: Showcase all classes used in integrating the OpenAI Assistants API into the Vivo Hackathon Project. Vivo leverages the OpenAI Assistants API to analyze and make clinical lab results palatable to everyday people, empowering patients to ask more insightful questions and make informed decisions about their health.

## Introduction

According to the American Clinical Laboratory Association, more than 7 billion clinical lab tests are performed in the U.S. each year, providing critical data for a relatively 'small' expenditure. These clinical laboratory tests have an immesurable impact on diagnostic and treatment decisions made by health care providers. The result is earlier diagnosis and treatment, which lead to better prevention, and better therapy with fewer side effects. 

While these lab results provide an overview of a patients' current health, it doesn't take other variables into condition such as: diet, exercise, genetic conditions of a family, etc. Lab results/companies were not designed to account for these variables, yet they are essential to provide a holistic view of a patient.  

## Purpose

**Knowledge Empowerment**

Modern lab tests are an innovation in technology and science. With these innovations, oftentimes, patients who are reading the results may not directly understand the nuance or reasoning that leads to a finalized good/bad result. While patients should always consult with a physician regarding their lab test results, we seek to empower patients who are curious and want to explore all of their available options.

For example, a patient may receieve test results that indicates that their cholesterol is a little high. Understanding the meaning of the results means that an individual also understands the difference between good/bad cholesterol, genetic family history, diet, exercise, HDL, triglycerides, LDL and other contextual information. 

Let's say a patient understands the meaning of their results and has assessed various options that they can take to lower their cholesterol. If a physician suggests to perscribe medicine, the empowered patient can suggest 'natural' alternatives and see if they are viable before going on medication.  


**Vivo serves to:**

1. Assess a patients lab result and explain it in a palatable way
2. Leverage a patient's Apple Health information to personalize lab result explanations / next steps
3. Integrate an AI chatbot to each section of a lab result so that patients can ask add'l follow-up questions on a specific result
